# Presentation Overview

## Introduction
1. What is SHG?
2. What is it good for? (Applications, Strain)
3. Why does it work like this? (surface dipolar, centrosymmetry)
    a. Conceptual de quantica de SHG (procesos virtuales y reales)
    
    SHG is a nonlinear process where two photons interact with the target medium
    so that the energy from the incident laser beam is transferred to a beam
    with precisely double the original frequency (half the wavelength). This
    process does not involve the absorption of the photons, but relies on
    so-called virtual energy levels (Fig. 1, middle). SHG can only occur in
    materials that exhibit non-centrosymmetric structure. In biology, one such
    example is collagen, and most pharmaceutical crystals are also examples
    (whereas the amorphous form is not). One benefit of the technique is that it
    is straightforward to spectrally separate the SHG signal from other emission
    sources such as auto-fluorescence.
