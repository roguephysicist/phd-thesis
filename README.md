# Thesis Overview

2. chi2
    * New additions to chi2
    * Overview of TINIBA 
    * Improvements made with addition of new cluster and integrating DP
    * How we coded the theory into TINIBA
    * appendices with math
    * adding Vnl from dp
3. SHG Yield
    * Combine 3layer-shg.tex into shgyield, to create one super-document
    * Talk about how derived equations are totally consistent with Sipe et al.
    * Radiation models for SHG developed
    * Coding nonrefco
3. Results
    * Comparison with Si(111) 1x1 (article)
    * Multiple reflections
4. Conclusions
    * How we improved on old calculations, both in quality and speed
    * Future work on the coding, implementation of gw, mbpt, tddft, etc.
