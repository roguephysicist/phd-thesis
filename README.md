Length Gauge Theory of Surface Second Harmonic Generation
=========================================================

Abstract
------------
We present a theoretical review of surface second harmonic generation (SHG) from semiconductor surfaces based on the longitudinal gauge. This layer-by-layer analysis is carefully presented in order to show how a surface SHG calculation can be readily evaluated. 

This derivation includes the contribution from the nonlocal part of the psuedopotentials, the correctly implemented scissors correction, and the layered cut function.
