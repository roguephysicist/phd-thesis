# Thesis Overview

1. Intro
    Ask for nicolas thesis to get clues.
2. Theory
    * New additions to chi2
    * Radiation models for SHG developed
    * New model with multiple reflections
3. Code
    * Overview of TINIBA 
    * Improvements made with addition of new cluster and integrating DP
    * How we coded the theory into TINIBA
    * Coding nonrefco
3. Results
    * Comparison with Si(111) 1x1
    * Recalculate and calculate for all other Si surfaces, look for experiment data (major housecleaning on shg-si-surfaces)
    * Multiple reflections
4. Conclusions
    * How we improved on old calculations, both in quality and speed
    * Future work on the coding, implementation of gw, mbpt, tddft, etc.

# To consider
* If we should add additional work on Graphite or Graphene
* Appendices with code
