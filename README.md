    * How we coded the theory into TINIBA
    * appendices with math
    * adding Vnl from dp
3. SHG Yield
    * Combine 3layer-shg.tex into shgyield, to create one super-document
    * Talk about how derived equations are totally consistent with Sipe et al.
    * Radiation models for SHG developed
    * Coding nonrefco
