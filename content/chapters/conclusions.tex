\section{Conclusions}
I was able to learn and successfully apply the XP2SHG/SFG technique to a series
of nanoparticles that were unfortunately not of sufficient optical quality to
yield meaningful results. This was accomplished by using established methods
(with the help of very capable people) to study samples that were not properly
characterized. The obvious solution to this would have been to use other
nanoparticles, but it was very much beyond my possibilities to obtain other
samples within the time constraints imposed by my visit to the Femtosecond
Spectroscopy group.

My suggestions for a revisionary work are the following.

\begin{description}
\item[Better quality samples.] The scattering problem can be completely
eliminated with samples that are in good physical condition.
\item[Well characterized samples.] The purpose of this work was to characterize
the nanoparticles via nonlinear spectroscopy. However, these measurements work
much better if applied in conjunction with previous studies of the samples, such
as TEM scans, linear measurements, etc.
\item[Apply the XP2SFG technique to metallic nanoparticles.] There are few
references available on sum frequency studies involving metallic nanoparticles,
especially in the two beam configuration. I think that using proper samples with
a NOPA in the XP2SFG configuration would provide excellent characterization of
the samples and interesting results.
\end{description}

\section{Future Work}
I think that every work of experimental science has its fair share of setbacks,
complications, and difficulties. Sometimes the work itself can be very difficult
or even dangerous. Other times, the work is so cutting edge that problems have
to be solved as they come without the help of literature. Regardless of the
scope of the work, \emph{all} experimentation is very touch-and-go business --
you arm yourself with the best tools available for the job and hope for the
best. This work had its share of complications and setbacks, chief amongst these
was the constant breakdown of lasers in both countries. Then, the poor quality
of the samples which only came to light after they were in place and ready to be
measured. Lastly, the lack of information about the samples did not allow for
the systematic study needed to get the most out of this project.

Fortunately, Stephen Jay Gould once said that, ``Honorable errors do not count
as failures in science, but as seeds for progress in the quintessential activity
of correction.'' With that in mind I summarize what was learned from this.

First, the XP2SHG/SFG technique is fairly unique and specialized even amongst
groups that are dedicated to surface optics and nonlinear optical techniques.
Learning how this technique works and how it is used will be invaluable for
future work in this field. Actually having seen it in use, and then using it for
myself in the company of the people who pioneered it was a rewarding and
educational experience.

Second, while the results were inconclusive, the types of measurements done on
these types of samples are new and unexplored. There is much work to be done
with these kinds of materials and I hope that this work can serve as a starting
point for other interested scientists. I have no doubt in my mind that better
samples would have yielded excellent new results.

Lastly, this entire work helped broaden my knowledge of nonlinear optics in
general, as well as the many experimental techniques used everyday by scientists
everywhere. Even so, I only possess a very small portion of the ``big picture''
needed to understand every aspect of this work. There is still a lot to be
learned about surface optics and nonlinear techniques and I hope that this work,
at the very least, will pique the readers' interest on these topics.
