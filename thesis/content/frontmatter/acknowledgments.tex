This thesis is the culmination of over four years of collaborative team work. I
am very grateful to everyone that helped me along the way.

First and foremost, my advisor and partner in crime Bernardo, who was with me
every step of the way for over four years. His guidance and friendship will
always be appreciated.

I am very grateful to all my colleagues at the Laboratoire des Solides
Irradi\'es in France. In particular, Nicolas Tancogne-Dejean and Val\'erie
V\'eniard for their excellent guidance and hard work on this project. I have
them to thank for two publications.

I am very grateful towards the CONACyT and the CIO for the financial support and
infrastructure contributed towards this work.

I also wish to thank my parents, Mike and Ana, for the considerable support they
have given me throughout the years. They have always supported my endeavors in
all possible ways.
