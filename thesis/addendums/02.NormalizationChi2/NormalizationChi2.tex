\section*{First Case: Bulk Materials}

Let us first consider the case of a bulk material, that is conformed entirely of
a supercell with no vacuum region. A unit cell is repeated indefinitely in every
direction, thus creating a three-dimensional reproduction of an infinite
material. From Fig. \ref{fig:bulk}, we can see that the volume of each unit cell
is $\Omega = L^{3}$. We calculate $\boldsymbol{\chi}(-2\omega;\omega,\omega)$
using the TINIBA \cite{tiniba} software suite; for ease of notation,
$\boldsymbol{\chi}(-2\omega;\omega,\omega) = \boldsymbol{\chi}_{T}$ ($T$ for
TINIBA).

\begin{figure}[b]

\caption{The bulk supercell is repeated indefinitely along the $z$ and
$\hat{\boldsymbol{\kappa}}$ axes. There is only material present, with no vacuum
region between each repeat.}
\label{fig:bulk}
\end{figure}

For the bulk calculation, $\boldsymbol{\chi}_{T}$ must be normalized over the
volume of the unit cell (i.e. $1/\Omega$); this normalization happens
automatically in TINIBA. Thus, no further action is necessary and the
susceptibility can be used as is. Finally, we establish that
$\boldsymbol{\chi}_{T} = \boldsymbol{\chi}_{b}$, where $\boldsymbol{\chi}_{b}$
is the desired susceptibility for our bulk system. Calculated in this fashion,
$\boldsymbol{\chi}_{b}$ has the appropriate MKS units of m/V.

\section*{Second Case: Surfaces}

Now, we will consider calculating $\boldsymbol{\chi}(-2\omega;\omega,\omega)$
for surfaces. This is done following the theoretical framework established in
Ref. \cite{andersonPRB15}. Just as for the bulk case, we use the supercell
method that repeats each cell across all directions (see Fig.
\ref{fig:surface}). However, we represent the surface by using a slab of
material with finite height; this necessarily implies that there are regions of
empty space between each repeat. The slab has both upper and lower surfaces, and
we can extract the response for each by use of the cut function.

\end{figure}

Fig. \ref{fig:sf_supercell} depicts a representative supercell for a surface material. As mentioned above, it is necessary to include the cut-function to extract the surface response. For instance, a centrosymmetric material will always yield $\boldsymbol{\chi}(-2\omega;\omega,\omega) = 0$, except at the surface where the symmetry is broken. If we calculate the response from the entire slab, the contribution from the bottom half will cancel out the top half; thus, we use the cut function to only calculate over the desired region. For most surfaces, we can simply 

The blue shaded region represents the \emph{half-slab}
