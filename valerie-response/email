Dear Valerie and Nicolas,

Happy new year! We hope you had an excellent holiday.

As it turns out, our three layer model had some mistakes that we have corrected.
Attached to this email are both a response to your notes (response.pdf), and our
full notes (shg-yield.pdf) including all the derivations for your reference in
case you wish to review them.

We hope that they will help clarify any doubts that remain for calculating R. We
will rapidly revise the manuscript depending on your answer to the question we
pose in the Conclusions section of the responses.pdf document.

Have a good week and we eagerly await your reply.

Sean and Bernardo
